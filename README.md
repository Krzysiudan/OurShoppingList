# OurShoppingList
Aplication for sharing shopping or task lists with family or friends.
Data is saved on firestore database(NoSql database). Aplication is available in english and polish.

There is a RecyclerView with list of a lists and after clicking on an item you have two tabs: planned and bought items. Selecting an item will push it to another tab. 
You can add lists and within the the list you can add, change and remove multiple items. By clicking on particular list you can share it with your friend by email adress. 
Whenever you are going to shopping you can notify your friends by clicking on a bell floating button, than type a message, and your buddies will be notified.

App is functional right now but I'm planning more changes like:
- Bottom navigation drawer
- Changes in FragmentDialog's style 
- Notification after invitations to friends


This is how my app looks like:
